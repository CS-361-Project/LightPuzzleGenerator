# LightPuzzleGenerator
A random puzzle generator for the game.
Unfinished and messy.
Pull at your own risk :p

Current Version:
Pros:  
Generates levels of specified size and complexity  
Levels cannot be shortcut  
Levels can get fairly challenging (even 4x4)  
Cons:  
Slow for large levels or levels with complexity counts close to their size
